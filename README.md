# Star Wars Adventure Game

A fun, interactive "choose your own adventure" game inspired by Star Wars! This project is written in Python using Flask to create a simple web application. It is designed as an educational tool to show computer science students how AI coding agents can help you quickly spin up web applications with minimal effort.

## Features
- Choose your own path through an original Star Wars themed adventure.
- Simple Flask web interface.
- Example of rapid prototyping with AI-assisted coding.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:
